# Web dev journey

The best way to learn anything and especially to code is in my opinion to have a clear plan and clear goal in mind.

You need to learn by intension, meaning you need to solve the **“how”** to get **“where”**. Coding is all about problem solving.

The “where” can be anything: you might want to start a blog, launch the new Tinder for dogs or create the website for a business you have in mind.

You’ve got to start small and I think web development is one of the easiest and most versatile skills to pickup right now.

## Start by learning the basics of a website

To reach your goal you need to start by the basics, learn `HTML`, `CSS` and `JavaScript`.

A good analogy to understand why you need to learn those three languages is:

- HTML is the Skeleton, it defines the structure
- JavaScript is the brain and muscles, it will manage the logic and the interactions
- CSS is the skin/clothes, it manages the overall look and feel

A good place where to start is by learning using those resources [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/catalog), [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/default.asp) and [Mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/).

Some are free and some are with a fee, but those skills being in high demand it definitely worth the price.

## Find a mentor (Optional but recommended!)

I started learning coding alone without any guidance and help, I wish I had someone to guide towards the right tech and help me focus on the right thing. This is maybe one the most important tip that will make you grow SO MUCH FASTER: find a mentor.

They will help you when you stuck, they will motivate you and more importantly they will inspire you!

## Use your new skills to implement a cool design

You now know the basics, it's time to get your hands dirty and code a real life example. Take a website that you love or pick a cool design on [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/shots/popular/product-des) and code it!

Some cool examples:

## Learn NPM and React

This one is really opinionated, there is many more library/framework available but React is the one that will help you landing the more jobs and also is by far the easiest to pickup.

It will help you make professional web app, create complex flow and any king of interactions easily.
It's widely adopted by the community and you can find an endless number of library to help you on your journey.

It's being used by the best out there: Facebook, Airbnb, Instagram, Shopify, Paypal, Dropbox to name a few.

The best place to start in by reading the [official documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html) you can also refer to Codecademy's course which is really nice.

## Find a project, learn, code, fail, repeat

Project based learning is the fastest way to pickup any new tech. Find a project you want to work on, it can be anything - an idea of yours or you can copy another one.
